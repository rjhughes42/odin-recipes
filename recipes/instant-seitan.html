    <p>Instant Pot seitan, use in place of meat for stir-fry, soup, or sandwiches</p>
    <ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>2-¼ cups vital wheat gluten</li>
        <li>1-15 oz can or 1.5 cups black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>½ cup veggie broth (or water)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup reduced sodium soy sauce (or Less Sodium NoSoy if soy-free)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h4>Instructions</h4>
        <li>To make this seitan, first blend your beans up until they're a paste and the skins are mostly broken down. You can do this in a blender or a food processor. Add the spices and soy sauce at the same time so all the flavor will be well distributed.</li>
        <li>Next, add your vital wheat gluten and vegetable broth (or water). Blend or process until well combined.</li>
        <li>Now transfer the dough to a bowl and combine it with your hands. It should be moist, but not sticky. The dough should stick to itself, not your fingers. Knead the dough for just about 10-15 seconds (overkneading can cause it to turn out rubbery) and form a log.</li>
        <li>Instant Pot Cooking Instructions: Add a cup of water to the base of your Pressure Cooker and insert the steaming basket. Add the seitan log to the steaming basket, close the lid, set the pressure valve to "sealing" and cook on high pressure for 45 minutes. When the timer goes off, turn off your Instant Pot and let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then carefully quick release the rest (there won't be much left anyway)--I like to use a wooden spoon to release the pressure so my hands aren't anywhere near the escaping hot steam.</li>
        <li>Stove Top Cooking Instructions: Follow the process above to make your seitan log, then add it to a steaming basket or steamer pot on your stove top with about 2 cups of water (you'll be cooking a bit longer). Place a lid on the pot and steam on medium high for about 1 hour, 15 minutes. How long your seitan takes will depend on the thickness of the log. Anything under 4 inches thick should not take longer than an hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let your seitan rest about 10 minutes before carving. It will be fully cooked at this point, so you can eat it straight up or you could add it to a stir fry or a sauce or whatever else you like!</li>
        <li>Refrigerate leftovers up to 5 days in an airtight container (reheat in the microwave with a damp towel over it or reheat by steaming until hot over stove top). Can also freeze and thaw out, then also reheat the same way.</li>
    </ol>
