    <p>A nut-free tofu based cheeze from  <a href="zardyplants.com">zardyplants.com</a> </p>
    <ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>1 block (396 grams) firm tofu, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons tapioca starch</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (if you do not have a high-speed blender you may need to mince these first) or 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (use unfortified for a more authentic color)</li>
        <li>About Â½ cup of water (you want it slightly thicker than cake batter)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h4>Instructions</h4>
        <li>Blend all ingredients on high until creamy and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour into a medium non-stick saucepan and heat on medium heat (I do 5 or 6'o clock on the dial).</li>
        <li>Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon constantly for 3-4 minutes. Sauce will start to curdle and separate. Just keep stirring.</li>
        <li>You will know the sauce is done when it is stretchy like melted mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>After cooking, immediately (within 20-ish minutes), spoon it (I like to use two spoons or two small spatulas) onto whatever dish you like. Bake if desired. Reheats wonderfully on whatever it is put on.</li>
    </ol>
